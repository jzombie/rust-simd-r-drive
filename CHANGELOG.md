## [0.15.0-alpha] - 2025-09-25
### Breaking
- Default payload alignment increased from 16 bytes to 64 bytes to ensure
  SIMD- and cacheline-safe zero-copy access across SSE/AVX/AVX-512 code
  paths. Readers/writers compiled with `<= 0.14.x-alpha` that assume
  16-byte alignment will not be able to parse 0.15.x stores correctly.

### Added
- Debug/test-only assertions (`assert_aligned`, `assert_aligned_offset`)
  to validate both pointer- and offset-level alignment invariants.

### Changed
- Updated documentation and examples to reflect the new 64-byte default
  `PAYLOAD_ALIGNMENT` (still configurable in
  `src/storage_engine/constants.rs`).
- `EntryHandle::as_arrow_buffer` and `into_arrow_buffer` now check both
  pointer and offset alignment when compiled in test or debug mode.

### Migration
- Stores created with 0.15.x are not backward-compatible with
  0.14.x readers/writers due to the alignment change.
- To migrate:
  1. Read entries with your existing 0.14.x binary.
  2. Rewrite into a fresh 0.15.x store (which will apply 64-byte
     alignment).
  3. Deploy upgraded readers before upgrading writers in multi-service
     environments.

## [0.14.0-alpha] - 2025-09-08
### Breaking
- Files written by 0.14.0-alpha use padded payload starts for fixed alignment.
  Older readers (<= 0.13.x-alpha) may misinterpret pre-pad bytes as part of the
  payload. Upgrade all readers/writers before mixing file versions.

### Added
- Fixed payload alignment for zero-copy typed views. Payloads now begin
  at an address that is a multiple of `PAYLOAD_ALIGNMENT`, configured in
  `src/storage_engine/constants.rs` via:
  - `PAYLOAD_ALIGN_LOG2`
  - `PAYLOAD_ALIGNMENT = 1 << PAYLOAD_ALIGN_LOG2`
- Experimental `arrow` feature which exposes `as_arrow_buffer` and `into_arrow_buffer`
  methods in `EntryHandle`.

### Changed
- Internal on-disk layout: each non-tombstone payload may be preceded by
  a small zero pre-pad (0..A-1 bytes) to satisfy alignment (A is the
  configured alignment). Public API is unchanged.

### Migration
- Regenerate stores with the new version:
  1) Open the old store with the matching old binary and read entries.
  2) Write each entry into a new 0.14.0-alpha store.
  3) Replace the old file after verification.
- If you maintain separate services, deploy reader upgrades before
  writer upgrades to avoid mixed-version reads.
